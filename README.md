###ABOUT THE PROJECT
<i>Hello, and welcome to my attempt to learn JavaFx.</i>

The goal of this project is for me to 
be able to work on a byte-sized file editor, making it progressively more complex and 
feature-rich. Hopefully, sometime in the future this will be a pretty functional app and 
a starting point for other, more advanced projects.

###FEATURES

Right now the editor is pretty bare-bones. I hope to change that.

**current features**

* text file saving
* text file loading
* resetting editor
* writing text in the editor

**upcoming features**

* icons
* key listener
* multiple file types for saving
* advanced text editing features
* UI redesign

**stretch goals**

* animations
* custom file explorer
